## Description of Idea
- **🤔Problem:**

 We all have cleared JEE and obviously then only got admission in some **IIT or NIT** or any other institute. So, we all have gone through the hustle and problems we face during **college selection and choice filling after the JEE Main and Advances examinations**. Many students get better colleges and branch because they fill the choice filling form wisely, it takes them to do **some research to fill a good choice filling. And there are also many students who can not get that college and branch, which they had been got according to their AIR, its because of their lack of research.**
 - **💎Solution(Idea)**:
 
 So, to help those students, we are making **collegeget.com** , which will help them to do some research before doing choice filling. Now, you can say that there are already many websites for the same work like **shiksha.com , collegedunia, etc**. But as we have also used them during our JEE journey, we know that they don’t show the data that accurately, and I think they have also not made **there websites much organized, plus the lots of ads and phone calls you start getting on signing up on those websites. So, to give the students a better option we thought to make College Get, where we have focused more on giving them a more organized place as well as in place of showing fake data, we have used data from official websites of the colleges** 💪
